My Portfolio

visit at https://erniekins.github.io.


Started with a template from Ryan Fitzgerald https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio-template, and have modified it a bit to make it more me. I am not done fixing it up and hope to fix the links and descriptions to my python and Ruby projects once I get them re-uploaded to github or running on aws again.
